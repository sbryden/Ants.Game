### Description
We need to enhance the user experience in the Ants.Game application by making the following modifications:

1. **Expand Map Size:** Increase the size of the map by 100x while ensuring no changes are made to the ants' behavior.

2. **Add Zooming Capabilities:** Implement zooming functionality to allow users to zoom in and out of the map for better navigation and visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The map size is expanded to 100x its current dimensions.
- Ant behavior and functionality remain unaffected by the change in map size.
- A user-friendly zoom in/out feature is added to the application, allowing users to adjust their view with ease.

#### Additional Notes:
Please ensure that performance remains optimal after introducing these changes. If there are potential challenges or limitations to implementing these features, kindly outline them in the comments.

### Motivation
To provide an improved and engaging user experience for navigating and interacting with the Ants.Game map.
